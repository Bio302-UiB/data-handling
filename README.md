# Data handling with tidyverse

Importing and cleaning data usually take up the vast majority of time spent working on a project. The statistical analysis is often fairly quick and done in a few lines of code. 
To make an analysis reproducible, we need to do all the data processing with code (rather than editing files in Excel).

This project is designed to help you process your raw data entirely with R so that it is ready for plotting and statistical analysis. 

It contains the following tutorials

- 1-loading-data.Rmd
- 4-dates-and-times.Rmd
- 5-text-manipulation.Rmd

To run a tutorial, open the file in RStudio and click the `Run Document` button that appears above the text.
It will take a few moments to compile the tutorial, then it should open in a new window.
If you run the tutorials in the BIO302 workspace on Rstudio.cloud, all the packages should have been installed for you. 
If you run it on your own computer, you will need to install several packages.
